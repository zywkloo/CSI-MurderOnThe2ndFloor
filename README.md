# Crime Scene Investigator - cuHacking 2020
* [WINNER of Murder on the 2nd Floor](https://devpost.com/software/murder-on-2nd-floor-web-forensic-analyzer)  [[Martello](https://martellotech.com/)]
* Restore crime scene with high fidelity in time and space dimensions to help analyze suspects!

## Inspiration
[Martello forensic data analytic challenge](https://martellotech.com/cuhacking/)

## What it does
A tool to help the forensic team to simulate crime scenes and analyze the suspects by their behaviour based on time and space.

## How We built it
We made full use of the modern web technology like `Plotly.js`, `Node.js`, `Express` to build an analyzer restoring the crime scene with high fidelity.

## Challenges We ran into
* None of us has experience in the visualization library.

## Accomplishments that We're proud of

* An application can be used to investigate the crime scene.

 ### Three Key Features

* Uplodaers: 
  * It allows uploading JSON file (eg, Murder-on-the-2nd-Floor-Raw-Data.json) to analyze the data of all suspects. 
  * The user could designate the murder scence (room #).
This fits users with dynamic analytical requirements.

* Timeline viualization: A visualization web application shows the behaviour of all suspects according to the timeline on the 2D building layout.

* Spatial viualization: Based on the the murder room input by the user, the occurrence frequency of all supsects would be marked in the 3D box.

 ### Outcome
*  Rather than offering a conclusion based on a specific given data, we offerd a data visualization tool to help the user (the police, the analyst) come up with their own judgement. 

## What We learned
- Learned how to discuss an unfamiliar problem with teammates from different programming backgrounds.
- Learned how to modify data visualization library to meet our purpose

## What's next for Crime Scene Investigator
- We could narrow down the suspects by analyzing their behaviour and time data if we have more time.
- Provide uploading different building layouts, e.g. AutoCAD
