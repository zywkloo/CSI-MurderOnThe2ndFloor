# Crime Scene Investigator - cuHacking 2020
* MurderOn2ndFloor-WEB 
* Restore crime scene with high fidelity in time and space dimensions to help analyze suspects!

## Inspiration
Martello forensic data analytic challenge
https://martellotech.com/cuhacking/

## What it does
A tool to help the forensic team to simulate crime scenes and analyze the suspects by their behaviour based on time and space.

## How I built it
We took advantage of the modern web technology like `d3.js`, `WebGL`, `Plotly.js`, `Node.js` to build an analyzer restoring the crime scene with high fidelity.

## Challenges I ran into
* None of us has experienced in the visualization library.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of

* An application can be used to investigate the crime scene.
* It allows updating JSON file (eg, Murder-on-the-2nd-Floor-Raw-Data.json) to service to analyze the data of all suspects.

* The murder room will be put in and marked on the 3D.
* A visualization web application shows the behaviour of all suspects by the time and space.

## What I learned
- Learned how to discuss an unfamiliar problem with teammates from different programming backgrounds.
- Learned how to modify data visualization library to meet our purpose

## What's next for Crime Scene Investigator
We could give more advice on reducing the suspects by correlating their behaviour and time data by algorithms if we have more time.
